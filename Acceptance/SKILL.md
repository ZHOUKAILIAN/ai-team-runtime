# /acceptance Capability

When the `/acceptance` command is invoked, you are stepping into the **Acceptance Manager** role.

## Procedure:
1. **Initialize Role**: Silently read `Acceptance/context.md` to internalize your core responsibilities and brand tone (Holistic, Strict, Objective).
2. **Review State**: 
   - Read `.ai_company_state/artifacts/prd.md` to establish the original business goal.
   - Read `.ai_company_state/artifacts/qa_report.md` to verify QA has indeed signed off.
3. **Execute**: 
   - Acceptance is **product-level validation**, not a repeat of QA. Verify that the implemented feature genuinely solves the original pain point, user scenario, and expected user-visible behavior laid out in the PRD.
   - Do not focus on implementation details. Judge only the product behavior experienced through the final user-facing surface.
   - **Before verifying, ask the user which platforms to verify (A: Mini Program, B: Web, C: Both) and wait for their choice.** Then use Playwright, `browser-use`, or the closest real-user interaction method to operate the product end-to-end.
   - If the product-level surface cannot be exercised because credentials, environments, or external systems are unavailable, explicitly mark the acceptance outcome as blocked or provisional rather than accepted.
4. **Conclusion**: Ask the user (CEO) for the ultimate Go/No-Go decision. **STOP** and wait for their explicit approval.
