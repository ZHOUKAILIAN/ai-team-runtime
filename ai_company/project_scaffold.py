# AI_Team Run

## Goal

Run the AI_Team workflow in the current repository while preserving Product, Dev, QA, Acceptance, and human decision ownership.

Best practice: invoke this skill only when Codex is opened at the target project's root directory.

## Workflow Isolation Contract

- AI_Team is the stage controller for the active session.
- Generic methodology skills may assist inside a stage.
- Generic methodology skills must not change the AI_Team stage order, approval gates, or artifact ownership.
- Generic methodology skills must not replace QA with Dev self-verification or replace Acceptance with code review.

## Available assets

- `scripts/company-init.sh`: local setup helper that generates `.codex/agents/` and `.agents/skills/ai-team-run/`; generated files stay out of git.
- `scripts/company-run.sh`: local session bootstrap helper that prints `session_id`, `artifact_dir`, and `summary_path`.
- `.codex/agents/`: local Product, Dev, QA, and Acceptance agents for this repository.
- `.ai_company_state/artifacts/<session_id>/`: session-scoped artifacts and handoff files.
- `ai-team`: runtime CLI backed by `ai_company/cli.py`, exposing the `ai-team start-session` bootstrap entrypoint.

Read the available helper assets before choosing the bootstrap path.

## Workflow Contract

- Read the generated `workflow_summary.md` and the active session artifact directory.
- If subagents are available, prefer the local agents from `.codex/agents/` for Product, Dev, QA, and Acceptance.
- Product writes `prd.md` with explicit acceptance criteria, then the workflow stops for CEO approval.
- After approval, Dev and QA iterate until QA produces independent evidence or blocks with concrete findings.
- Acceptance writes `acceptance_report.md` with an AI recommendation only.
- Stop at the human Go/No-Go decision instead of auto-closing the workflow.

## Rules

- Use session-scoped artifacts under `.ai_company_state/artifacts/<session_id>/`.
- Never collapse QA into Dev self-verification.
- If QA or Acceptance lacks real evidence, mark the workflow as `blocked`.
- If subagents are unavailable, follow the same stages sequentially in the current session.

## Completion Signals

- `prd.md` exists and the workflow is waiting for CEO approval.
- `implementation.md` exists with self-verification evidence and a QA regression checklist.
- `qa_report.md` exists with independently rerun verification evidence and an explicit decision.
- `acceptance_report.md` exists with `recommended_go`, `recommended_no_go`, or `blocked`.
- The workflow stops for the human Go/No-Go decision instead of treating AI recommendation as final.

## Required Artifacts

- `prd.md`
- `implementation.md`
- `qa_report.md`
- `acceptance_report.md`
- `workflow_summary.md`
