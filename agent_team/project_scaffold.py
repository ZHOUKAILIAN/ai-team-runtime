# Agent Team Run

## Goal

Run the Agent Team workflow in the current repository while preserving Product, Dev, QA, Acceptance, and human decision ownership.

Best practice: invoke this skill only when Codex is opened at the target project's root directory.

## Workflow Isolation Contract

- Agent Team is the stage controller for the active session.
- Generic methodology skills may assist inside a stage.
- Generic methodology skills must not change the Agent Team stage order, approval gates, or artifact ownership.
- Generic methodology skills must not replace QA with Dev self-verification or replace Acceptance with code review.

## Compatibility

- Agent Team is opt-in. Use it when the work should be routed through the Product -> Dev -> QA -> Acceptance handoff.
- Ordinary AI Q&A style development stays valid for one-off edits, investigations, and ad hoc work that do not need the session/state-machine layer.
- If a change is already running inside an Agent Team session, write progress and evidence back to the session artifacts instead of treating ad hoc chat notes as the source of truth.

## Available assets

- `scripts/agent-team-init.sh`: local setup helper that generates `.codex/agents/` and `.agents/skills/agent-team-run/`; generated files stay out of git.
- `scripts/agent-team-run.sh`: local runtime-driver helper that calls `agent-team run-requirement` and prints `session_id`, `artifact_dir`, and `summary_path`.
- `.codex/agents/`: local Product, Dev, QA, and Acceptance agents for this repository.
- `agent-team`: runtime CLI backed by `agent_team/cli.py`, exposing `agent-team dev` for human terminal workflows and `agent-team start-session` for explicit bootstrap.
- `.agent-team/<session_id>/`: the session-scoped runtime directory; `artifact_dir` points here and session metadata lives beside the artifacts.
- `.agent-team/<session_id>/stage_runs/<run_id>_trace.json`: non-skippable runtime trace for `contract -> context -> acquire -> execute -> submit -> verify -> advance`.
- `.agent-team/memory/<Role>/raw|extracted|graph`: layered memory for original findings, extracted reusable rules, and relation edges.
- `agent-team status`: user-friendly project / role / status summary.
- `agent-team panel` / `agent-team panel-snapshot`: read-only visibility tools for current action, blockers, evidence, and recent events.

Read the available helper assets before choosing the bootstrap path.

## Terminal Usage

For human-operated terminal workflows, prefer:

```bash
agent-team dev
```

This confirms the requirement, confirms acceptance criteria, asks for a technical plan confirmation, and then preserves the runtime gates while delegating execution through `codex exec`.

## Workflow Contract

- Prefer `agent-team run-requirement` so the runtime acquires, executes, submits, verifies, and advances stages.
- A passed runtime-driven stage must have a complete trace; missing trace steps are blocking, not advisory.
- Memory retrieval is keyword-first with CLI search over raw/extracted/graph layers; use graph/AI reasoning only for weak implicit relationships.
- Read the generated `status.md`, `workflow_summary.md`, and the active session directory.
- If subagents are available, prefer the local agents from `.codex/agents/` for Product, Dev, QA, and Acceptance.
- Product writes `prd.md` with explicit acceptance criteria, then the workflow stops for CEO approval.
- After approval, Dev and QA iterate until QA produces independent evidence or blocks with concrete findings.
- Acceptance writes `acceptance_report.md` with an AI recommendation only.
- Stop at the human Go/No-Go decision instead of auto-closing the workflow.

## Rules

- Use the explicit `artifact_dir` and `summary_path` printed by the runtime; they resolve into `.agent-team/<session_id>/`.
- Never collapse QA into Dev self-verification.
- If QA or Acceptance lacks real evidence, mark the workflow as `blocked`.
- If subagents are unavailable, follow the same stages sequentially in the current session.

## Completion Signals

- `prd.md` exists and the workflow is waiting for CEO approval.
- `implementation.md` exists with self-verification evidence and a QA regression checklist.
- `qa_report.md` exists with independently rerun verification evidence and an explicit decision.
- `acceptance_report.md` exists with `recommended_go`, `recommended_no_go`, or `blocked`.
- The workflow stops for the human Go/No-Go decision instead of treating AI recommendation as final.

## Required Artifacts

- `prd.md`
- `implementation.md`
- `qa_report.md`
- `acceptance_report.md`
- `workflow_summary.md`
